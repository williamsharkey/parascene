# CSS Style Guidelines

## Core Principle: Standardization and Consistency

**Always prioritize standardization and reusability over duplication.**

- **Don't reinvent the wheel** - Before writing new CSS, check if similar styles already exist that can be reused or extended
- **Minimize CSS duplication** - Avoid writing the same styles in multiple places; extract common patterns to global.css
- **Maintain consistency** - Use the same spacing, colors, typography, and patterns across all pages and components
- **Think globally first** - When adding styles, consider: "Could this be useful elsewhere?" If yes, put it in global.css
- **Standardize patterns** - If you find yourself writing similar CSS multiple times, create a reusable class or pattern in global.css
- **Keep CSS minimal** - The goal is to have as little CSS as possible while maintaining a consistent, polished experience across the entire app

When adding new styles, always ask:
1. Does a similar pattern already exist?
2. Can this be made reusable?
3. Will this need to be used elsewhere?
4. Can this be standardized across the app?

## Formatting
- Use tabs (not spaces) for indentation
- Use single-line property declarations (one property per line)
- Use lowercase for property names and values
- Use single quotes for strings when needed
- Add blank lines between logical sections/selectors
- Use consistent spacing around colons and semicolons

## Structure
- Group related selectors together
- Place media queries immediately after the base styles they modify
- Use CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for colors, spacing, and other repeated values
- Prefer mobile-first responsive design (base styles for mobile, then @media (min-width) for larger screens)
- When adding mobile-specific styles, use @media (max-width: 768px) for mobile breakpoint

## Padding/Margin
- Use fixed pixel values for padding/margin when appropriate (e.g., `padding-bottom: 96px` for mobile bottom nav spacing)
- Avoid complex calc() expressions unless necessary for safe-area-inset or dynamic calculations
- Prefer simple, readable values

## Border Radius Standardization
Use consistent border-radius values across the app:
- `4px` - Small interactive elements (close buttons, small badges)
- `6px` - Buttons, inputs, small cards, badges
- `8px` - Medium cards, images
- `10px` - Standard cards, containers
- `12px` - Larger cards, sections
- `14px` - Modals, large containers
- `50%` - Circular elements (avatars, icons)
- `999px` - Pill-shaped elements (tabs, rounded buttons)

When in doubt, use: `6px` for buttons/inputs, `10px` for cards, `14px` for modals.

## Selectors
- Use class selectors over ID selectors
- Keep specificity low when possible
- Use semantic class names that describe purpose, not appearance

## Comments
- Use comments to separate major sections
- Comment complex or non-obvious CSS logic
- Keep comments concise and clear

## Media Queries
- Place media queries near the related base styles
- Use consistent breakpoints: 768px for mobile/tablet, larger values for desktop
- Group media query styles together when modifying the same selector

## CSS Organization: Where Styles Belong

### global.css
Use for styles that are:
- **Shared across multiple pages** (header, footer, navigation, modals, buttons, forms)
- **Web component styles** (app-navigation, app-navigation-mobile, app-modal-profile, app-modal-credits, app-modal-notifications, etc.)
- **Global layout and typography** (body, html, base element styles)
- **CSS custom properties** (CSS variables in :root)
- **Reusable utility classes** (route-empty, btn-primary, etc.)
- **Common patterns used in multiple places** (cards, lists, forms, modals)

Examples:
- `.header`, `.mobile-bottom-nav` - used across pages
- `.feed-card`, `.route-empty` - reusable patterns
- `app-navigation`, `app-navigation-mobile`, `app-modal-profile`, `app-modal-credits`, `app-modal-notifications` - web component styles

### Page-specific CSS (e.g., index.css, creator.css, consumer.css)
Use for styles that are:
- **Unique to a single page** and not reusable elsewhere
- **Page-specific layout overrides** (e.g., landing page header behavior)
- **Page-specific body classes** (e.g., `body.landing-page`)
- **Styles that only make sense in the context of that specific page**

Examples:
- `body.landing-page header` - landing page specific header styling
- `body.creation-detail-page`, `.creation-detail-route`, `.creation-detail-hero` - creation detail page specific styles
- `.publish-modal` - modal only used on creation detail page
- Page-specific hero sections, feature grids, etc. that don't appear elsewhere

### Web Component CSS
- **All web component styles go in global.css**, not in separate files
- Components are JavaScript classes (e.g., `AppNavigation`, `AppModalProfile`) and their styles are defined in global.css using their tag names (e.g., `app-navigation`, `app-modal-profile`)
- Use the component's tag name as the selector (e.g., `app-navigation`, `app-route-feed`)
- **Exception: Shadow DOM components** - Components using shadow DOM (e.g., `app-modal-credits`, `app-modal-profile`, `app-modal-notifications`) may have inline styles in their JS files due to style isolation, but should follow the same standardized patterns (modal structure, border-radius values, spacing) as defined in global.css

### Decision Guidelines
1. **If it's used in 2+ pages** → global.css
2. **If it's a web component** → global.css
3. **If it's a reusable pattern** → global.css
4. **If it's truly page-specific and won't be reused** → page CSS file
5. **When in doubt, prefer global.css** - it's easier to move styles later than to duplicate them

## Example Structure
```css
.selector {
	property: value;
	another-property: value;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
	.selector {
		mobile-property: value;
	}
}
```

## TODO Files

When the user asks about TODOs or wants to manage TODO items:
- **Read and edit** `_docs/TODO.json` - This is the main TODO data file that contains the list of tasks
- **Read** `_docs/TODO.md` - This contains documentation about how TODO.json works (cost, impact, rebalancing, etc.)
- The TODO.json file is used by the API route at `api_routes/todo.js` to serve and manage TODO items
- Do not modify TODO.md when TODO.json changes - TODO.md is documentation only
