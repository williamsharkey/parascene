# TODO

## Cost

`cost` reflects expected effort and complexity to deliver the item. Higher cost means more engineering time, more moving parts, or greater risk of hidden work.

## Impact

`impact` reflects the expected user or business value once the item ships. Higher impact means it materially improves outcomes, adoption, or retention.


## Rebalance

When I ask for a "rebalance" of TODO `cost` and `impact` values, I mean:

- Recalculate the numeric scores across the current list so they are comparable to each other.
- Use the full 1-100 scale for each metric.
- The highest `cost` item should be 100, and the lowest `cost` item should be 1.
- The highest `impact` item should be 100, and the lowest `impact` item should be 1.
- Preserve relative ordering between items (if A > B before, A should stay > B after).
- Use a linear rescale across the remaining items.


## Remove / Add

If an item is removed or added, rerun the rebalance so the scores stay aligned to the new set.
